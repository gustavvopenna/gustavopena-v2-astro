## Experience

### **Senior Frontend Developer**  
**Fondeadora | Mexico | 2023-Present**  
- Built version 1 of Fondea Compras from scratch, implementing a testing suite for integration tests, reducing production errors by 90% compared to other apps in the company. This also enabled the product to scale to 2,200 credit requests in less than a month, resulting in 2 million pesos in approved credit.
- Led the research and evaluation of options for implementing GraphQL on the frontend, executed using React Query. This approach significantly reduced the implementation time for new services and greatly improved the developer experience by ensuring full type safety. Additionally, it enhanced error handling and component-level loading state management, while also reducing code complexity.
- Collaborated with the product team and the Actinver bank team to implement a tax payment module that integrated with a third-party service, boosting monthly active users by 20% in its first month and delivering a downstream flow impact of 200M pesos.

### **Frontend Developer**  
**Bejamas | Remote | 2022**  
- Delivered a proof-of-concept for a static website for a Swiss telecommunications company, leveraging Hugo, Go, and Strapi as the CMS, ahead of schedule. This successful POC enabled the company to decide to adopt these technologies in production.

### **Frontend Developer**  
**Worky.mx | Mexico | 2020-2021**

### **Junior Frontend Developer**  
**Rocket.la | Mexico | 2019-2020**
